"""P4Runtime Switch Connection Management Module.

This module provides a gRPC-based client for communicating with P4Runtime-enabled
switches. It handles device configuration, table entry management, counter operations,
and packet I/O through a P4Runtime interface.

Classes:
    SwitchConnection: Main class for P4Runtime switch communication
    GrpcRequestLogger: Interceptor for logging gRPC requests
    IterableQueue: Queue wrapper for iteration support

Functions:
    ShutdownAllSwitchConnections: Cleanup all active switch connections
